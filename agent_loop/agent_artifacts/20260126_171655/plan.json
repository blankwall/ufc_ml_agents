  "key_missed_areas": [
    "Opponent quality gap: Gaethje's opponent_quality_score (0.361) was 4.6x higher than Pimblett's (0.078), but model only gave 50.9% to Pimblett. This massive experience differential against elite competition was undervalued.",
    "Age-experience interaction: Gaethje is 37 (7 years older) but has maintained elite performance against top-tier opponents. Model's age features may penalize older fighters too uniformly without accounting for fighters who maintain performance through elite competition experience.",
    "Opponent quality magnitude: The opponent_quality_score_diff (0.282) was substantial but may need non-linear scaling or interaction features to properly weight extreme differences in competition level.",
    "Striking differential vs volume control: Gaethje had better striking_differential (5.2) but Pimblett had better striking_volume_control (1.41). Model favored volume control, but differential may be more predictive when combined with opponent quality context.",
    "Elite competition experience: Gaethje's avg_opponent_win_rate (0.715) vs Pimblett's (0.515) represents fundamentally different levels of competition. This gap may need stronger feature representation or interaction terms."
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    "The opponent_quality_score feature may need non-linear transformation (e.g., log scale or squared) to properly weight extreme differences. A 4.6x difference should be more impactful than linear scaling suggests.",
    "Age-related features may need interaction terms with opponent_quality_score to identify older fighters who maintain elite performance through experience against top competition. Age alone may be too simplistic.",
    "A new feature combining opponent_quality_score with recent performance (e.g., 'elite_competition_recent_form') could capture fighters who've proven themselves against top-tier opponents recently, which may be more predictive than raw opponent quality alone.",
    "The striking_volume_control feature may be over-weighted relative to striking_differential when opponent quality context is considered. Fighters with high differential against elite competition may be undervalued.",
    "A feature measuring 'years_of_elite_competition' (weighted by opponent quality over time) could better capture sustained elite-level experience, which may be more predictive than point-in-time opponent quality metrics."

  "proposed_iterations": [
    {
      "iteration_number": 1,
      "target": "Top 25% confidence",
      "description": "Add non-linear transformation to opponent_quality_score_diff feature (e.g., log(1 + opponent_quality_score_diff) or opponent_quality_score_diff^2) to better weight extreme differences in competition level. This will help the model recognize when one fighter has faced significantly better competition (like Gaethje's 0.361 vs Pimblett's 0.078).",
      "rationale": "The 4.6x difference in opponent quality scores suggests a fundamentally different level of competition, but linear scaling may not capture the true impact. Non-linear transformation will amplify extreme differences.",
      "expected_impact": "Better identification of fighters with elite competition experience, improving predictions in high-confidence scenarios where opponent quality gaps are substantial."
    },
    {
      "iteration_number": 2,
      "target": "Underdog performance",
      "description": "Create interaction feature 'age_x_opponent_quality_score_diff' that multiplies age_difference by opponent_quality_score_diff. This will help identify older fighters (like 37-year-old Gaethje) who maintain elite performance through extensive experience against top competition.",
      "rationale": "Age alone penalizes older fighters, but older fighters with elite competition experience may maintain performance better than those without. This interaction captures fighters who've proven themselves against top-tier opponents over time.",
      "expected_impact": "Better predictions for experienced fighters facing younger opponents, especially when the older fighter has maintained elite-level competition. Should improve underdog identification when experience matters."
    },
    {
      "iteration_number": 3,
      "target": "Top 25% confidence",
      "description": "Add feature 'elite_competition_recent_form' that combines opponent_quality_score with recent win rate (e.g., opponent_quality_score * win_rate_last_3). This captures fighters who've recently proven themselves against elite competition, which may be more predictive than raw opponent quality alone.",
      "rationale": "Gaethje's combination of high opponent quality (0.361) with recent wins (0.667 win rate last 3) represents sustained elite performance. This feature will better identify fighters who've maintained success against top competition recently.",
      "expected_impact": "Improved predictions for fighters with both elite competition experience and recent success, particularly in high-confidence scenarios where both factors align."
    },
    {
      "iteration_number": 4,
      "target": "Underdog performance",
      "description": "Create feature 'striking_differential_adj_opp_quality' that multiplies striking_differential by opponent_quality_score. This weights striking differential by the quality of competition faced, recognizing that a +5.2 differential against elite opponents (like Gaethje) is more meaningful than the same differential against weaker competition.",
      "rationale": "Gaethje's striking_differential (5.2) was achieved against much better competition than Pimblett's. The model may undervalue striking differential when not contextualized by opponent quality. This feature provides that context.",
      "expected_impact": "Better evaluation of striking metrics when contextualized by competition level. Should improve underdog predictions when experienced fighters have strong metrics against elite competition."
    },
    {
      "iteration_number": 5,
      "target": "Top 25% confidence",
      "description": "Add feature 'opponent_quality_ratio' that divides f1_opponent_quality_score by f2_opponent_quality_score (with smoothing to handle division by zero). This ratio feature will better capture relative differences in competition level, making extreme ratios (like 4.6x) more impactful than simple differences.",
      "rationale": "The ratio of 0.361 / 0.078 = 4.6x better represents the magnitude of difference than the absolute difference (0.282). Ratio features can be more interpretable and impactful for multiplicative relationships.",
      "expected_impact": "Better identification of substantial competition level gaps, improving high-confidence predictions when one fighter has faced significantly better opponents throughout their career."

    {
      "iteration_number": 6,
      "target": "Underdog performance",
      "description": "Create feature 'avg_beaten_opponent_quality_vs_opponent_avg' that compares avg_beaten_opponent_win_rate to avg_opponent_win_rate. This measures whether a fighter beats opponents who are better than their average opponent (indicating ability to win against quality competition). Gaethje's beaten opponents (0.709) were better than his average opponents (0.715), showing consistent elite performance.",
      "rationale": "Fighters who consistently beat opponents at or above their average competition level demonstrate ability to perform against quality competition. This feature captures that pattern, which may be more predictive than raw opponent quality metrics alone.",
      "expected_impact": "Better identification of fighters who consistently perform well against quality competition, improving underdog predictions when experience and consistency matter."
