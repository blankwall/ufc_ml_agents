  "key_missed_areas": [
    "Opponent quality differential (0.282 opponent_quality_score_diff) was not weighted heavily enough despite Gaethje facing significantly tougher competition (0.715 vs 0.515 avg opponent win rate)",
    "Age/experience interaction features did not properly capture the value of veteran experience (37 vs 30 years) when facing less-tested opponents, especially in high-stakes matchups",
    "Common opponent analysis (2 common opponents) showed 0.0 performance differential, suggesting the feature may not be capturing relative performance quality effectively",
    "Striking differential (+5.20 for Gaethje) was undervalued relative to Pimblett's striking volume control advantage, indicating the model may overvalue volume metrics over efficiency",
    "The model's top features (f2_striking_volume_control, takedown_ability_diff) favored Pimblett, but did not account for Gaethje's superior track record against elite competition"
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    "The model underweights opponent quality when there's a significant gap, especially when the higher-quality fighter has maintained strong performance against elite competition",
    "Age difference features may not capture the nuanced value of veteran experience when combined with sustained high-level performance and superior opponent quality",
    "Common opponent performance features may need to weight the quality of common opponents or adjust for recency/context of those shared matchups",
    "Striking metrics may need better balance between volume control and efficiency/differential, especially when one fighter has proven success against elite strikers",
    "The interaction between opponent quality and recent form may need enhancement - Gaethje's recent wins against quality opponents should carry more weight than Pimblett's wins against lower-tier competition"

  "proposed_iterations": [
    {
      "iteration": 1,
      "target": "Top 25%",
      "description": "Add a weighted opponent quality interaction feature that multiplies opponent_quality_score_diff by recent_vs_career_win_rate_diff to better capture when experienced fighters maintain form against elite competition. This targets high-confidence predictions where the model may miss subtle quality advantages.",
      "feature_name": "opponent_quality_x_recent_form_interaction",
      "rationale": "Gaethje had both superior opponent quality (0.282 diff) and maintained strong recent form, but the model didn't weight this combination properly. This feature would help identify when quality fighters are in good form."
    },
    {
      "iteration": 2,
      "target": "Underdog",
      "description": "Enhance common_opponent_performance_diff to weight performance by opponent quality and recency, creating a quality-adjusted common opponent score. This helps identify when underdogs have actually faced and performed better against shared opponents than favorites.",
      "feature_name": "common_opponent_quality_adjusted_diff",
      "rationale": "Despite 2 common opponents, the feature showed 0.0 diff. A quality-adjusted version would better capture when one fighter's performance against shared opponents was more impressive, which is valuable for underdog identification."
    },
    {
      "iteration": 3,
      "target": "Top 25%",
      "description": "Create an age_x_opponent_quality interaction feature that captures when older fighters with superior opponent quality face younger fighters with weaker competition history. This helps in high-confidence predictions where experience + quality should be weighted more heavily.",
      "feature_name": "age_x_opponent_quality_interaction",
      "rationale": "Gaethje's 7-year age advantage combined with 0.282 opponent quality advantage should have been a stronger signal. The model may not capture this interaction effectively in current features."
    },
    {
      "iteration": 4,
      "target": "Underdog",
      "description": "Add a striking_efficiency_vs_volume_balance feature that compares striking_differential to striking_volume_control, identifying when efficiency (differential) should outweigh volume metrics. This helps identify underdogs who are more efficient strikers despite lower volume.",
      "feature_name": "striking_efficiency_advantage",
      "rationale": "Gaethje had +5.20 striking differential but Pimblett had better volume control (1.41 vs 0.996). The model favored volume, but efficiency against quality opponents may be more predictive, especially for underdog identification."
    },
    {
      "iteration": 5,
      "target": "Top 25%",
      "description": "Enhance avg_beaten_opponent_win_rate_diff with a recency weight, creating avg_beaten_opponent_win_rate_recent_diff that focuses on quality of opponents beaten in last 3-5 fights. This better captures recent quality of competition for high-confidence predictions.",
      "feature_name": "avg_beaten_opponent_win_rate_recent_diff",
      "rationale": "Gaethje's beaten opponents had 0.709 win rate vs Pimblett's 0.464, but this may be diluted by older fights. A recent-focused version would better reflect current competitive level, important for confident predictions."

    {
      "iteration": 6,
      "target": "Underdog",
      "description": "Create a title_fight_experience_diff feature that captures the difference in title fight or main event experience between fighters. Veterans with title fight experience often perform better in high-pressure situations, which is valuable for underdog identification.",
      "feature_name": "title_fight_experience_diff",
      "rationale": "Gaethje likely has significantly more title fight/main event experience than Pimblett, which wasn't captured in the prediction. This experience gap is particularly valuable for identifying when experienced underdogs have advantages in high-stakes matchups."
