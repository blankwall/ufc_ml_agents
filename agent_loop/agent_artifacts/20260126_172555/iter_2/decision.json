  "reasoning": "While iteration 2 improved Top 25% accuracy by +1.34 percentage points (0.7785 → 0.7919), it significantly degraded underdog Top 25% performance: accuracy dropped from 0.591 to 0.524 (-6.7 pp) and ROI dropped from 0.52 to 0.38 (-14 pp). Additionally, overall accuracy decreased from 0.67 to 0.6498 (-2.02 pp). The recent_form_quality_adjusted_diff feature appears to be over-weighting quality-adjusted recent form, which helps identify favorites but harms underdog identification. This follows the same pattern as iteration 1, where improvements to Top 25% came at the expense of underdog performance. Both priorities must be maintained, and the degradation in underdog performance outweighs the modest Top 25% improvement.",

  "next_steps": "The recent_form_quality_adjusted_diff feature approach is too aggressive in favoring favorites. Need a more balanced approach that improves Top 25% accuracy without degrading underdog performance. Consider: (1) Fixing the common_opponent_performance_diff feature calculation (currently showing 0.0 when it should have values) - this provides direct matchup context without bias toward favorites, (2) Creating interaction features that combine existing signals more subtly (e.g., striking_differential_x_opponent_quality_diff) rather than adding new quality-adjusted features that may over-weight favorites, (3) Exploring threshold-based features that only activate for extreme differences, preserving underdog signal in closer matchups. The goal is to find features that improve confidence calibration for both favorites and underdogs simultaneously."
