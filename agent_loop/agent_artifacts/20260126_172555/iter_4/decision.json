  "reasoning": "The interaction feature 'striking_differential_x_opponent_quality_diff' achieved the intended balance, improving both primary goals simultaneously. Top 25% accuracy improved from baseline 0.7785 to 0.8121 (+3.36 percentage points), which is the primary objective. Critically, underdog top 25% performance also improved: accuracy increased from baseline 0.591 to 0.609 (+1.8 pp) and ROI improved from 0.52 to 0.63 (+0.11). This contrasts with iterations 1-3, which improved Top 25% accuracy but degraded underdog performance. The selective activation of the interaction feature (requiring both striking advantage AND quality advantage) successfully identified elite-level favorites without over-penalizing underdogs, demonstrating that interaction features can be more balanced than direct amplification approaches. Overall accuracy is slightly down from baseline (0.6667 vs 0.67, -0.33 pp) but improved from iter 3 (0.6599), and the key metrics show strong gains.",
