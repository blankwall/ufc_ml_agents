  "reasoning": "The change improved Top 25% accuracy from 0.7785 to 0.8333 (+5.48 percentage points), which is positive. However, it significantly degraded underdog top 25% performance: accuracy dropped from 0.591 to 0.476 (-11.5 percentage points) and ROI decreased from 0.52 to 0.25 (-52% relative decrease). While Top 25% accuracy is the primary priority, the severe underdog regression (-11.5 pp accuracy loss) outweighs the Top 25% gain (+5.48 pp). The squared feature appears to be too aggressive in favoring favorites, making it harder to identify valuable underdog opportunities. The overall underdog accuracy improved slightly (0.6725 to 0.6796), but the top 25% underdog segment - which is critical for betting profitability - was significantly harmed.",

  "next_steps": "Instead of squaring the opponent_quality_score_diff (which amplifies all differences uniformly), consider a more nuanced approach: (1) Create a threshold-based feature that only activates for extreme quality differences (e.g., >0.2), preserving the signal for large gaps without over-penalizing moderate differences that might favor underdogs. (2) Alternatively, implement the 'recent_form_quality_adjusted_diff' feature from iteration 2 of the plan, which compares recent performance while accounting for opponent quality - this may improve Top 25% accuracy without as much negative impact on underdog identification. (3) Consider interaction features that combine opponent quality with other factors (like recent form or striking differential) rather than simply amplifying the quality difference alone."
