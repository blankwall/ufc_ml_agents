  "key_missed_areas": [
    "Opponent quality differential significantly under-weighted: Gaethje's opponent_quality_score (0.36) vs Pimblett's (0.078) represents a 4.6x advantage, yet model only assigned 52.7% win probability",
    "Age penalty may have over-compensated for experience advantage: 7-year age difference (37 vs 30) penalized Gaethje without properly accounting for his superior competition level and proven track record against elite opponents",
    "Striking differential advantage (5.2) not sufficiently weighted: Gaethje's significant striking differential advantage was not reflected in the confidence level",
    "Common opponent analysis feature shows 0.0 despite 2 common opponents existing: The common_opponent_performance_diff feature failed to capture meaningful head-to-head context",
    "Recent form context missing: Both fighters show similar recent win rates (0.667), but Gaethje's recent form came against significantly higher quality opponents (avg opponent win rate 0.715 vs 0.515), which should be a distinguishing factor",
    "Opponent quality-adjusted recent performance not captured: The model has time_decayed_win_rate_adj_opp_quality features but may not be properly weighting the quality-adjusted metrics in recent form comparisons"
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    "The opponent_quality_score_diff feature (0.282) is not being weighted heavily enough relative to other features, causing the model to underestimate favorites with significant quality advantages",
    "Age interaction features may be creating a double penalty: age_difference combined with age_x_* features may be over-penalizing older fighters even when they have compensating advantages in experience and opponent quality",
    "The model may need a feature that captures 'recent form quality-adjusted' - comparing recent performance while accounting for the quality of opponents faced during that period",
    "Common opponent analysis is not functioning correctly (showing 0.0 when 2 common opponents exist), suggesting the feature calculation or data pipeline has an issue",
    "Striking differential features may need interaction with opponent quality to properly weight striking advantages against elite competition vs lower-tier competition",
    "The model may benefit from a composite 'elite experience score' that combines opponent quality, title fight experience, and performance against top-tier opponents"

      "description": "Increase the feature importance/weighting of opponent_quality_score_diff in the model. The current gap of 0.282 (Gaethje 0.36 vs Pimblett 0.078) represents a massive quality differential that should drive higher confidence for the favorite. This targets Top 25% confidence predictions by ensuring significant opponent quality advantages are properly recognized.",
      "rationale": "Gaethje's 4.6x opponent quality advantage should have resulted in higher confidence (>60%) rather than the marginal 52.7% prediction. The model is under-weighting this critical signal.",

      "description": "Create a new feature 'recent_form_quality_adjusted_diff' that compares recent win rates (last 3-5 fights) while weighting each win/loss by the opponent_quality_score of the opponent faced. This would distinguish between fighters with similar recent records but vastly different competition levels, helping identify true favorites who have proven themselves against elite competition.",
      "rationale": "Both fighters showed 0.667 recent win rate, but Gaethje's wins came against opponents with avg win rate 0.715 vs Pimblett's 0.515. This quality-adjusted recent form should be a key differentiator for Top 25% confidence predictions.",

      "description": "Fix and enhance the common_opponent_performance_diff feature calculation. Currently showing 0.0 despite 2 common opponents existing. Implement proper calculation that compares head-to-head performance against shared opponents, and ensure the feature is properly populated in the data pipeline. This provides direct matchup context that should boost confidence when one fighter has clearly outperformed the other against mutual opponents.",

      "target": "Top 25%",
      "description": "Create an interaction feature 'striking_differential_x_opponent_quality_diff' that multiplies striking_differential by opponent_quality_score_diff. This ensures that striking advantages are weighted more heavily when achieved against elite competition, distinguishing between fighters who dominate lower-tier opponents vs those who excel against top competition. This targets Top 25% confidence by properly valuing elite-level striking performance.",
      "rationale": "Gaethje's striking differential (5.2) was achieved against much higher quality opponents. The model should weight this more heavily than similar differentials against weaker competition. This interaction feature will help the model distinguish elite-level performance.",

This creates a unified metric for 'proven elite-level performance' that should be a strong predictor for high-confidence favorites. This targets Top 25% confidence by identifying fighters with comprehensive elite experience advantages.",
      "rationale": "Gaethje had advantages across multiple elite experience dimensions (opponent quality 0.282 diff, beaten opponent win rate 0.245 diff, title fight experience). A composite feature that captures this holistic advantage would improve Top 25% confidence predictions.",
