  "reasoning": "The common_opponent_performance_diff bug fix improved Top 25% accuracy by 2.69 percentage points (0.7785 → 0.8054), which is a meaningful improvement for the primary priority. While underdog top 25% performance degraded slightly (accuracy: 0.591 → 0.571, ROI: 0.52 → 0.49), this degradation is less severe than previous iterations (iter 1: accuracy dropped to 0.476, ROI to 0.25; iter 2: accuracy dropped to 0.524, ROI to 0.38). The bug fix ensures the feature now provides meaningful signal when common opponents exist, which should help with confidence calibration. The feature is theoretically neutral (based on direct comparative evidence), but in practice it appears to slightly favor favorites. Given the significant Top 25% improvement and the moderate nature of the underdog degradation, this change should be kept. However, future iterations should monitor and potentially adjust how this feature interacts with underdog identification.",
