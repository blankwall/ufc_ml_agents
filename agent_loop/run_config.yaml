# Agent Loop Run Configuration
# This file controls the goal/priorities for a single run
# Edit this file before each run to change focus

# ============================================
# RUN GOAL - What should this run optimize for?
# ============================================
# Choose ONE or MORE from: "top_25_pct", "underdog", "overall_accuracy", "calibration"
run_goal:
  - "underdog"      # Focus on underdog predictions
  # - "top_25_pct"   # Focus on high-confidence predictions
  # - "overall_accuracy"  # Focus on overall accuracy
  # - "calibration"  # Focus on probability calibration

# ============================================
# PRIORITIES - What to optimize
# ============================================
priorities:
  # Which segments to prioritize (choose from run_goal)
  prioritize:
    - "underdog"

  # Which segments to explicitly avoid (optional)
  avoid:
    - "favorites"

# ============================================
# CONSTRAINTS - What NOT to do
# ============================================
constraints:
  # Features/concepts to avoid adding
  avoid_features:
    - "quality differences"  # Don't add threshold/interaction quality features
    - "ratio features with small denominators"

  # Other constraints
  max_new_features_per_iteration: 5
  prefer_existing_features_over_new: true

# ============================================
# SUCCESS METRICS - When to keep changes
# ============================================
success_criteria:
  # Minimum improvement required to keep changes
  min_roi_improvement: 0.01  # 1% ROI improvement

  # Priority segments that MUST improve
  required_improvements:
    - segment: "underdog"
      metric: "accuracy"
      min_delta: 0.005  # 0.5% accuracy improvement

    - segment: "underdog"
      metric: "roi"
      min_delta: 0.02  # 2% ROI improvement

# ============================================
# RUN SETTINGS (optional - overrides agent_loop_config.json)
# ============================================
# Uncomment to override for this specific run
# run_settings:
#   n_iters: 10
#   model: "claude-opus-4-5-20251101"
